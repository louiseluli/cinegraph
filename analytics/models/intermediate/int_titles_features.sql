-- analytics/models/intermediate/int_titles_features.sql
-- Purpose:
--   Numeric/boolean *feature view* for ML/recs from analytics.int_titles.
--   Keeps only machine-friendly columns and produces basic normalizations.
--
-- Inputs (from int_titles):
--   - identity: tconst
--   - titles: primary_title, english_title (kept for debugging/inspection)
--   - numerics: start_year, decade, runtime_minutes, average_rating, num_votes,
--               director_count, writer_count, cast_count
--   - booleans: is_adult, genre flags (g_action...g_western)
--   - categories: primary_genre (we one-hot a small stable set)
--
-- Normalizations (per full table):
--   - rating_norm: (average_rating - min) / (max - min)
--   - votes_log   : ln(1 + num_votes)
--   - votes_norm  : (votes_log - min) / (max - min)
--   - runtime_norm: (runtime_minutes - min) / (max - min)
--   - year_norm   : (start_year - min) / (max - min)
--   - crew/cast norms via log1p with the same scheme
--
-- Notes:
--   - This is a VIEW so it always reflects latest data. If you need frozen training
--     snapshots, weâ€™ll materialize a TABLE with persisted stats in a later step.
